# Monitor
C# application to monitor Windows processes and kill the processes that work longer than a specified threshold

A small C# utility to monitor Windows processes and kill the processes
that work longer than the threshold specified:
This command line utility expects three arguments: a process name, its
maximum lifetime (in minutes) and a monitoring frequency (in minutes, as
well). When you run the program, it starts monitoring processes with the
frequency specified. If a process of interest lives longer than the allowed
duration, the utility kills the process and adds the corresponding record to the
log. When no process exists at any given moment, the utility continues
monitoring (new processes might appear later). The utility stops when a
special keyboard button is pressed (say, q).

Here is what I did
In the cmd, I wrote:
monitor.exe chrome 1 1 â€“ 

every other minute, the program verifies if a Chome process lives longer than 1 minute, and if it
does, the program kills the process, which it did and wrote the logs in the log file log.txt
